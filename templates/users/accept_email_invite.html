    Hi there, and welcome to Portfoliyo Village. We're glad you're here!
  </p>

  <p>
    First things first: we need you to pick a password for the site.
    In the future, you can come back anytime
    and log in using your email address and this password.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you've chosen a password,
    you'll be able to log in and see the messages posted regarding your student.
  </p>

  <form method="POST" id="set-password-form">
    {% csrf_token %}

    {{ form.non_field_errors }}

    {% include "forms/_field.html" with field=form.new_password1 %}

    {% include "forms/_field.html" with field=form.new_password2 label="Confirm new password" %}

    <div class="form-actions">
      <button type="submit">set your password</button>
    </div>

  </form>
  {% else %}
  <p>
    Well, this is a bummer.
    Seems like we can't find you based on the invitation link you used.
    Can you double-check the link in the email and try again?
    If that doesn't work, contact Harsh Patel
    at <span class="email">harsh(put the 'at' sign here)portfoliyo.org</span>
    and we'll get this sorted out.</p>
  </p>
